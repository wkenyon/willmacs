The \"basic\" code provides a set of convenience functions which
are traditionally considered shell builtins.  Since all of the
functionality provided by them is accessible through Lisp, they are
not really builtins at all, but offer a command-oriented way to do the
same thing." :tag "Basic shell commands" :group 'eshell-module)

Directory navigation involves changing directories, examining the
current directory, maintaining a directory stack, and also keeping
track of a history of the last directory locations the user was in.
Emacs does provide standard Lisp definitions of `pwd' and `cd', but
they lack somewhat in feel from the typical shell equivalents." :tag "Directory navigation" :group 'eshell-module)

This module implements the \"ls\" utility fully in Lisp.  If it is

ordinary strings." :tag "Value modifiers and predicates" :group 'eshell-module)

This module allows for special keybindings that only take effect
while the point is in a region of input text.  By default, it binds
C-a to move to the beginning of the input text (rather than just the
beginning of the line), and C-p and C-n to move through the input
history, C-u kills the current input text, etc.  It also, if
`eshell-confine-point-to-input' is non-nil, does not allow certain
commands to cause the point to leave the input area, such as
`backward-word', `previous-line', etc.  This module intends to mimic
the behavior of normal shells while the user editing new input text." :tag "Rebind keys at input" :group 'eshell-module)

This module causes visual commands (e.g., `vi') to be executed by
the `term' package, which comes with Emacs.  This package handles most
of the ANSI control codes, allowing curses-based applications to run

This module defines many of the more common UNIX utilities as
aliases implemented in Lisp.  These include mv, ln, cp, rm, etc.  If
the user passes arguments which are too complex, or are unrecognized
by the Lisp variant, the external version will be called (if
available).  The only reason not to use them would be because they are
usually much slower.  But in several cases their tight integration
with Eshell makes them more versatile than their traditional cousins
\(such as being able to use `kill' to kill Eshell background processes
by name)." :tag "UNIX commands in Lisp" :group 'eshell-module)
